# Linear Regression with R

What do we do when we want to understand the relationship between the size of a house and its price? Or what about the relationship between the size of a city and your company's expected profits?

When we want to understand the relationship between two numeric variables, we turn to linear regression.


### Food Trucks

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

How would you do that?

So you've looked at the data and convinced yourself that the size of a house causes its price to increase. That's great! But the thing is we already know the prices of these houses. So could you develop a model of that relationship that allows you to predict the price of a house you haven't even seen?

You can with linear regression.

Regression is concerned with specifying the relationship between a single numeric dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more numeric independent variables (the predictors).

As the name implies, the dependent variable depends upon the value of the independent variable or variables. In simple linear regression, we assume that the relationship between independent and dependent variables follows a straight line.

### Question
